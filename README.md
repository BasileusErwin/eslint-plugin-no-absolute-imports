# No Absolute Imports

The eslint-plugin-no-absolute-imports plugin is a custom ESLint rule that allows
you to verify and disallow absolute imports in your code.

## Installation

WIP

## Configuration

Once you have installed the plugin, you can configure it in your
.eslintrc file or in the ESLint configuration file you use in your project.

Here's an example of a basic configuration:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["no-absolute-imports"],
  "rules": {
    "no-absolute-imports/no-absolute-imports": "error"
  }
}
```
